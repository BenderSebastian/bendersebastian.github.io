  title={Rational Homotopy Theory},
  abstract={This survey was written as part of a "Project with Colloquium" at the Technical University of Munich in the fall of 2025. The
goal is to give an introduction to Rational Homotopy Theory and build
up the theory to state the Quillen-Sullivan Equivalence. We begin by
explaining the main ideas and motivation behind rational homotopy theory and what role the Quillen-Sullivan equivalence plays. We then give
overviews of some concepts regarding commutative differential graded algebras, simplicial sets and model categories. Using this we define the two
functors required to state our main theorem, which establishes a correspondence between certain rational homotopy types and certain algebraic
objects.},

  title={The Computation of the Radical of an Ideal},
  abstract={The central objects of the present study are ideals of polynomial rings in n variables and over a perfect
field. The goal of this thesis is to present an algorithm that computes the radical of such an ideal. After our
introduction, we give a brief overview of some basic results from commutative algebra that are used when
proving the correctness of the algorithms. Following the outline of the chapter on Gröbner bases in Kemper’s
book [Kem11], we also give a short introduction into the theory of Gröbner bases. For the main part of this
thesis, we follow Becker and Weißpfenning’s book [BW93], where the central strategy for computing the
radical of an ideal is to reduce the problem to the case where the ideal is zero-dimensional. When looking
at zero-dimensional ideals, we prove Seidenberg’s Lemma, which shows that for a generating set of the
radical of an ideal I, you only need a generating set of I and the squarefree parts of monic generators of
elimination ideals of I. For this, we show how to compute the monic generator of an ideal in a univariate
polynomial ring and how to compute squarefree parts of polynomials in one variable. Here we have to
distinguish between the two cases where the underlying field has characteristic 0 or p, with p being a prime
number. For the latter case we follow the paper by Gianni et al. [GT96] on squarefree decomposition, in
order to develop a method of computing the squarefree part in perfect fields with characteristic p. After that,
we introduce colon ideals and then the theory of extensions and contractions of ideals. This allows us to
generalize the algorithm, that computes radicals of zero-dimensional ideals, to arbitrary dimensional ideals.
After presenting the algorithm for computing the radical of an ideal, we show an example computation of
the radical of an ideal, to demonstrate the algorithm in a realistic setting.},
